# This task is about decision : A **Decision Tree** is a supervised learning model that mimics a tree-like structure to make decisions. It is widely used for both classification (e.g., categorizing emails into spam or not spam) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices) tasks.Each internal node in the tree represents a decision based on a feature of the data, branches signify outcomes of those decisions, and leaf nodes provide the final result or prediction. Decision Trees are favored for their simplicity, interpretability, and ability to model complex, non-linear relationships without requiring extensive data preprocessing.
# In practice, they work by splitting the data at each node using criteria like **Gini Impurity**, **Entropy**, or **Mean Squared Error**, depending on the type of task. The tree is built recursively until a stopping condition (e.g., maximum depth or minimum number of samples in nodes) is met.While easy to understand and apply, Decision Trees can overfit noisy data. To address this, techniques like **pruning** (removing unnecessary branches) or using ensemble methods like Random Forests are often employed. They are a powerful and adaptable tool for solving a variety of machine learning problems. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into specific aspects.
